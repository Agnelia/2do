## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with the following structure:

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/          # Data models and entities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/       # State management (Provider pattern)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/         # UI screens and pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # Business logic and external services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/         # Reusable UI components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # Helper functions and utilities
```

### Key Technologies
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **Provider**: State management
- **FL Chart**: Beautiful charts and graphs
- **Shared Preferences**: Local data persistence
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI components

## Data Persistence

The app uses SharedPreferences for local data storage, ensuring:
- **Offline Functionality**: Works without internet connection
- **Data Persistence**: Your reminders and progress are saved locally
- **Privacy**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Backup Ready**: Easy to implement cloud backup features

  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: Colors.teal, // Change this color
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
  useMaterial3: true,
),
```
